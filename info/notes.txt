Added source to telegram-api-1.1.127-shadow.jar by pointing eclipse to "../lib/telegram-api/"-directory
Find out return types by saving returns to an Integer, then click the eclipse error to see what type the variable should have, this is the return type.
Search for classes by using eclipse's auto-completion from the start package onwards (e.g. start with "org.telegram." then wait what it says)
